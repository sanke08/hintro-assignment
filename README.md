# Collaborative Task Manager

A powerful, real-time collaborative task management application built with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and powered by Socket.io for seamless team coordination.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Collaborative Task Manager is designed to streamline team productivity. It allows users to create workspaces, manage projects through boards, organize tasks into lists, and collaborate in real-time with team members. With feature-rich task cards, audit logs, and a built-in notification system, it provides a comprehensive solution for project management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for fast development and bundling
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for modern, responsive styling
- **Shadcn/UI** & **Radix UI** for accessible, premium components
- **Redux Toolkit** for global state management
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching
- **React Hook Form** with **Zod** for robust form validation
- **Socket.io-client** for real-time updates
- **Lucide React** for beautiful icons

### Backend

- **Node.js** & **Express** (ES Modules)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Prisma ORM** with **PostgreSQL**
- **Socket.io** for real-time bidirectional communication
- **JWT** for secure authentication
- **Bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **Zod** for API request validation

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modern, scalable architecture:

### Backend Structure (MVC-ish)

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Repositories**: Direct interaction with the database via Prisma.
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and apply middleware.
- **Middlewares**: Handle authentication, logging, and error handling.
- **Prisma**: Schema definition and database migration.

### Frontend Structure (Feature-based)

- **Features**: Modularized code grouped by functionality (e.g., `auth`, `boards`, `tasks`).
- **Components**: Shared UI components.
- **Store**: Redux store configuration and slices.
- **App/Layout**: Layout wrappers for different sections of the app.
- **Lib**: Third-party library configurations (e.g., Axios instance).

## ⚡ Real-time Features (Socket.io)

The application leverages **Socket.io** to provide a "Google Docs"-like collaboration experience:

- **Live Board Updates**: Any changes to lists or tasks (creation, movement, updates) are reflected instantly for all users viewing the board.
- **Room Management**: Users are grouped into rooms based on the `boardRef` they are currently viewing, ensuring updates are targeted and efficient.

## ✨ Features

- **Auth System**: Secure signup, login, and profile management.
- **Workspace Management**: Create multiple workspaces and invite members via unique invite codes.
- **Dynamic Boards**: Visual boards to organize project phases.
- **Organized Lists**: Categorize tasks into custom lists (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
- **Advanced Task Cards**:
  - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent).
  - Status tracking.
  - Due dates.
  - Assignees.
  - Detailed descriptions.
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed history of all activities within a workspace (Who did what and when).
- **Trash & Recovery**: Safely delete items and restore them from the trash if needed.
- **Advanced Task Search & Filtering**:
  - Search tasks by title or description.
  - Filter by Status and Priority.
  - Sort by Creation Date, Due Date, Priority, or Title.
  - **URL Persistence**: Filters are stored in URL search parameters, ensuring they persist across unmounts and are easily shareable.
- **Member Management**: Role-based access (Admin/Member) and workspace invitation system.
